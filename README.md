### Task Description
For my work experience at Policy In Practice, I have been tasked to create a number generator guessing game using python. The objectives of the task are:
```
- Greets the user
- Prompts them to guess the number from a given range of numbers
- Reads the user input
- Return a success message if they guess correctly
- Return an error message in case they don't. In that case, provide them with additional helpful information 
- Re-reads the user input and repeats again the previous process
```
This task requires me to use my previous python skills that I have learnt in school in order to have the computer program generate a number. I also need to use new skills of terminal and mainly GitHub in order to write the README file and then share my project with my supervisor through the use of Git commands (such as add, commit and push).

### How To Run The Project On A Local Machine
To run the code on your local machine from the GitHub file, you will firstly need to **clone the repository** from the GitHub file to your local machine. Then you should open the coding file in **VsCode** in which you can run the python code by pressing *run and debug*- which will run the code. The user will be asked to enter their name and then will be presented with a message and instructions on how to interact with the program. Then they should input numbers until they correctly guess the number that was generated by the computer. Once they have done this, the program outputs a message and is over.

### Writing And Testing The Code

>The image above shows an example of the code when it is being run. It shows that the system asks the user to enter their name so that they can receive a personalised welcome message. They are then told the objective of the game and are asked to enter their guess of a number between 1 and 100. Every time they enter a number, they are told if their guess is too high or too low, and when they guess the right number, they are given a *"Congratulations"* message and are told how many guesses it took them to get the correct answer.


### Relevant Sources I Used And Lessons I Learnt

Overall, the coding part of the task was pretty straightforward to me as I have done similar projects as part of Computer Science GCSE and A-level tasks. However, I did need to use the website, [How To Generate Random Numbers In Python](https://www.shiksha.com/online-courses/articles/how-to-generate-random-numbers-in-python/#:~:text=randrange(start%2C%20stop)%20function,between%201%20and%209%E2%80%8B), to help me generate a number within a certain range as I had forgotten how to do this.

A mistake I made initially was writing **input(int())** instead if writing **int(input())**. This generated an error which shows that precision in things like syntax are crucial in order for the program to run smoothly.

### Project Review

The best part of this project was writing the program itself. I really enjoyed watching it work fairly quickly as it is satisfying to watch code come to life. I also really enjoyed using this task to improve my skills of using *Terminal*. I decided to do most of my file creations and searches using terminal in order to practice the skills that I had learnt earlier in the week. I think *Terminal* is a very useful tool and I wanted to get used to using certain commands and it is something that I want to use after I have finished this week- in things like school Computer Science projects and just later work life.

The most difficult part of this whole project was getting used to using GitHub. I am not used to things like branching and merging between my personal file and an online repository. It took a lot of getting used to in order for me to understand fully what I was doing and the effect it had. I ended up making and deleting about 4 different repositories just because I kept on creating them in a way that I did not want- and I wanted to start them from scratch again and again until i had done it correctly- from creation to completion.

Overall, I really enjoyed working on this project as it helped me test my python skills and also exposed me to new applications which I am likely to use when I start a career in data related jobs.
