### Task Description
For my work experience at Policy In Practice, I have been tasked to create a number generator guessing game using python. The objectives of the task are:
```
- Greets the user
- Prompts them to guess the number from a given range of numbers
- Reads the user input
- Return a success message if they guess correctly
- Return an error message in case they don't. In that case, provide them with additional helpful information regarding the number: was it higher or lower than the one the target one?
- Re-reads the user input and repeats again the previous process
```
This task requires me to use my previous python skills that I have learnt in school in order to have the computer program generate a number. I also need to use new skills of terminal and mainly GitHub in order to write the README file and then share my project with my supervisor through the use of Git commands (such as add, commit and push).

### How To Run The Project On A Local Machine
To run the code on your local machine from the GitHub file, you will firstly need to **clone the repository** from this GutHub file to your local machine. Then you should open the coding file in VsCode in which you can run the python code.

### Writing And Testing The Code

The first part of the code is **import random**. This puts the function random in the code so that when I ask the computer to generate a number, it can use this function **random** in order to randomly generate a number.
